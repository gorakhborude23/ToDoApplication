Task Management Application to User

Open the TestReport folder for all to see API validation , unit test and UI validation reports.

I have created mock data with three users and assigned task to each of them. 

Close all open browser windows before running it. port 3000 should be available.

1.In the BackendWebAPI folder open TaskWebApi.sln in visual studio and run it. API should run on http://localhost/                                                        
2.In the Front end folder open task-management-app in the VS Code.                    
3. open the terminal and type npm start and hit enter. it should open application in 3000 port. currently API is configured for use of only 3000 port so make sure you use port 3000 only.  
4. Initially, it will show all the task assigned to user 1.           
5. you can mark task complete/pending using checkbox.         
6. Use filter drop down to filter the tasks.            
7. To change the user, you can change the url and instead of 1 , you can type 2 or 3
